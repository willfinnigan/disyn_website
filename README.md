# Disyn Website

This repository holds the Disyn Biotec website, which is hosted on github.  

It uses bootstrap 5 and other small components (no other javascript frameworks - just vanilla js).  

See the dev folder for useful resources for constructing the website, including copy, docs, and the development kit for the theme.

## Disyn Biotec
Disyn Biotec are a start-up in Manchester (UK) who are specialists in biocatalysis.  

Disyn Biotec are on a mission to make biocatalsis simpler, faster and easier to implement.  They do two types of activities:
1. Building on decades of biocatalysis know-how, Disyn Biotec offer a range of biocatalysis lab services, ranging from enzyme panel construction, screening, enzyme engineering, and reaction optimisation.  
2. Disyn Biotec are building AI tools which enable plan, evaluate, and execute the use of biocatalysis in the synthesis of molecules.  Building on the RetroBioCat platform, Disyn Biotec are developing the next generation of tools which will accelerate and de-risk biocatalysis, enabling cheaper, faster and more sustainable manufacturing.
